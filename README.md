# data-annotation-assignment

## Overview
This assignment involves extracting structured data from PDF invoices using Python.

## Files Included

- **`create_template.py`**: This script is responsible for generating a JSON extraction template based on a specific invoice format.
- **`extract_amount.py`**: This script extracts the invoice amounts, accommodating various ways the amounts may be formatted in the invoice.
- **`generalize_template.py`**: This script creates a more flexible JSON template that can handle different invoice formats without needing separate templates for each vendor.
- **`extract_headers.py`**: This script extracts essential header information, including the date, invoice number, and vendor name, from the invoices.
- **`extraction_template.json`**: A JSON file generated by `create_template.py`, which serves as the initial extraction template.
- **`generalized_template.json`**: A more versatile JSON file created by `generalize_template.py` to handle multiple invoice layouts.
- **`README.md`**: This file contains comprehensive documentation on how to set up and run the project, including code explanations.
- **`explanation_video.mp4`**: A video that provides a visual walkthrough of the project, demonstrating how the code works and its outputs.

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Open a command line interface.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the scripts.
4. Run each script using:
   ```bash
   python create_template.py
   python extract_amount.py
   python generalize_template.py
   python extract_headers.py
